# Submissions
class Submission(db.DynamicDocument):
    '''Submissions represent data collected by participants in response to
    questions in Checklist and Critical Incident forms. Submissions are created
    prior to data input and are updated whenever data is received. The only
    exception is for the storage of Critical Incident reports which create
    submissions when data input is received.

    The :class:`core.documents.Submission` model
    is a :class:`mongoengine.DynamicDocument` and hence, most of it's
    functionality isn't stored within the model and gets defined at run time
    depending on the configuration of forms, form groups and form fields.

    :attr:`updated` is a :class:`mongoengine.db.DateTimeField` that stores the
    last time the submission was updated.

    :attr:`created` is a :class:`mongoengine.db.DateTimeField` that stores the
    date of creation for the submission.

    :attr:`contributor` stores the contributing participant for
    this submission.

    :attr:`form` provides a reference to the form that the submission was
    made for.

    :attr:`completion` is a dictionary whose keys are the names of the
    groups defined on :attr:`form` (if any) and whose values are (as at the
    time of writing this) are Complete, Partial or Missing, based on if all
    fields within that group have been filled out. Please see the method
    _update_completion_status() for details.

    :attr:`location_name_path` is a dictionary with location type names as
    keys and actual location names as values. Since MongoDB doesn't support
    joins, it was created to be a precomputed shortcut to using the location
    hierarchy in queries and views without needing several database lookups.

    :attr:`sender_verified` is set to True if the sender of a submission has
    been verified. For instance, if it was received from a known phone number
    in the case of SMS, or a known user account (either via the UI or API).

    :attr:`quality_checks` stores the precomputed value of different logical
    checks (created at runtime, so we can't predict in advance). An example
    logical check would be: for this submission, was the total number of votes
    greater than the total number of registered voters?

    :attr:`verification_status` stores the overall result of all the logical
    checks: are there problems with this data, or is everything ok, or not
    enough data to have an opinion? see STATUS_CHOICES for the full list of
    possible values.

    IMPORTANT: submissions for incident forms get a few more dynamic fields:
        - status: whether the incident was confirmed/rejected etc
        - witness: whether the contributor actually witnessed the incident,
            was reported by a third party, etc
